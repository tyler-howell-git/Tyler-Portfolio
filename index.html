        <li>Tool-Assisted Grading</li>
        <p>Tool Assisted Grading (TAG) is a web-based application designed to help professors and TAs with monitoring and grading Capstone projects. I contributed to this project during my senior spring semester at the University of Memphis. My main area of focus, along with our sponsor's, was to containerize this application using Docker and get this application running on Google Cloud, so that University employee could easily access it.</p>
